# Issue 1
Sometimes the Server side takes too long to respond > 4000ms, and it assumes that there is a connection problem, if it was a real app, it must be a point of improvement.

**Suggestions:** 

1.Increase the load time before giving a connection error

2.Increase the Server Side Performance:
* Preconnect to required origins Error!
* Preload Largest Contentful Paint image Error!
* Ensure text remains visible during webfont load
* Registers an unload listener
* Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy 6 resources found**
